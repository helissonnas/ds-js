# Revisiting Data Structures with JS ‚ô•Ô∏è

Remembering what I studied in graduation, however, this time using Javascript as a tool.

Like any tool, JS has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
The overall idea here is to work around it while reinforcing my knowledge about data structures.

## But, what are Data Structures?

DS are techniques for storing and organizing data that make it easer to modify, navigate, and access.

Basically, we use them to organize different types of data for different purposes.

This means that we use them every time we do Computer Science, even that you do not notice.
